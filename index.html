        The slow fashion movement started in 2007 when Kate Fletcher, an English activist,
        <br>writer, designer, and sustainability professor coined the concept as a counterpart and response to fast
        fashion.
        <br>She defines slow fashion as quality-based rather than time-based. Other slow fashion pioneers note that the
        <br>movement encourages slower production, unifies sustainability with ethics, and ultimately invites consumers
        to
        <br>invest in well-made and lasting clothes.

    <h2>Designer Emilia Wick put it this way: <blockquote>"Slow fashion is a return to a personal relationship with fashion. A fashion where trends and seasons don't
        matter, but where your ethics and aesthetics blend seamlessly and you can escape the stress of constant
        consumption by focusing on the style you really like."</blockquote></h2>
